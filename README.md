# ToDo Rails
ToDo Rails is a basic app made with Ruby on Rails 5.2.1, this app allows you to add items, edit and delete them.

I'm going to show you technical details of the source code:

* The gems that were used are the following: 
`gem "haml-rails", "~> 1.0"`
`gem 'bootstrap', '~> 4.1.3'`
`gem 'font-awesome-sass', '~> 5.5.0'`
`gem 'faker'`

* The database is Postgresql.
* It's in [heroku](https://todorailsdom.herokuapp.com/).

### Thanks!
